 <h1>The Best Movies according to Liam</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</h3>
<p>I love this this british classic. Guy Ritchie's 1st release is gritty, funny and instantly quotable. </p>
 <h3>This is Spinal Tap</h3>
<p>I don't know of a funnier film than This is Spinal Tap. I first saw this when I started my own band and fell in love with the characters, storyline and the music. For a comedy film, there are some absolute bangers in there. So many great quotes and of course, you have to do it in their accents.</p>
 <h3>Mystery Men</h3>
 <p>This is funny, silly and again very quotable. Absolutely in love with this film. </p>
